NAME
	rose - Minimal browser based on webkit2gtk.

DESCRIPTION
	Rose is just basement for creating your own browser
	using gtk and webkit libraries. Every element inside
	is necessery for surfing and the end-user can just add
	what he need.

RATIONALE
	Nowadays browsers are generally full of useless
	functionalities with tones of code behind them.
	Rose has only tabs, cookies, caching and custom
	css support, but very hackable without any special
	knowledge. Bultin minimal user interface with
	autohiding distracting elements.

USAGE
	We have two main files - config.h and rose.c.
	First one is for changing settings, second for
	manipulating web content and gtk widgets. Just
	write own configuration and build using make.
	rose.h is file with all yank macros etc.
	You can change global style.css in:
		~/.config/rose/style.css
	I think thats all, have a nice day!
